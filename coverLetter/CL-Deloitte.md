Hi Hiring Manager,
I am a graduate student at Smith College (University of Maryland) writing to apply for a Data Analyst Position at Deloitte. Through Linkedin I learned about this position.

Your job description includes abilities in machine learning, and I have won a personal silver medal in the Kaggle M5 time series competition. In this competition, I used Xgboost, lightgbm and other high-performance algorithms to train the data, and used the time series cross-validation method to find the optimal parameters and maximize the generalization ability of the model. In the private leader board, the model I designed was shown to have good predictive performance on unknown datasets and effectively avoid overfitting.

The ability of programming in SQL is mentioned in your job description, which is also an
important part of my previous job. As a data analyst, I often write SQL to extract data through
various methods, especially window functions. I've worked with software engineers to monitor
and display the causes of failures of various APIs in the SaaS system. At the same time, I tracked
the use of new users and the loss of old users, and analyzed the reasons and characteristics of
user churn. In the end, our user churn rate has dropped by 3%, reducing the company's potential
losses. Drawing reliable conclusions from the data is my advantage, and I am also experienced in
building causal inference models using Python and R.

I look forward to discussing the data analyst position and my qualifications with you in
more detail. I’m available to talk at your convenience. I’ll be in touch next week to follow up and to
make sure you’ve received my application.
Sincerely,
Xiao(Seanny) Song
