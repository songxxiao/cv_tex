Dear Hiring Manager

I am a graduate student at Smith College writing to apply for E-Commerce Analytics Intern at Weqasa LLC company. Through Hiresmith I learned about this position. 

Your job listing mentions a need for someone who is experienced in business intelligence dashboard, both of which are areas I have extensive experience in. I have one year experience in FancyDigital, where I’ve honed my skills by manipulating numerous successful data analysis projects. While employed here, I’ve collaborated with my team to design KPIs and made dashboards to visualize the changes in user usage, which successfully raised the number of customers by 5% over the course of five months, contributing substantially to the company’s annual goals. I'm experienced in making and improving business intelligence dashboard.

The root cause analysis is mentioned in your job description. This is also an important part of my last job. As a data analyst, I often need to write SQL to extract data through various methods, especially pivot-table. Monitor and display the causes of failures of various APIs in the SaaS system. At the same time, I will monitor the use of new users and the loss of old users, and analyze the reasons and characteristics of user churn. In the end, our user churn rate has dropped by 3%, reducing the company's potential losses. Drawing reliable conclusions from the data is an important part of my last job and my advantage.


I look forward to discussing the Data Analyst position and my qualifications with you in more detail. I’m available to talk at your convenience. I’ll be in touch next week to follow up and to make sure you’ve received my application. 

Sincerely,

Xiao(Seanny) Song



你们的工作描述中提及了原因分析。这也是我上一个工作中的重要工作内容。作为一个数据分析师，我需要经常编写sql提取数据，通过各种方法，尤其是数据透视表的方式。监控并展示Saas系统中各种api出现故障的原因。同时，我会监控新用户的使用和老用户的流失，分析用户流失的原因和特征，最终我们的用户流失率下降了3%，减少了公司的潜在损失。从数据中得出可靠的结论是我上一份工作的重要内容，也是我的优势所在。
