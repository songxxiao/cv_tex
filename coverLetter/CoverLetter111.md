Hi Hiring Manager,
I am a graduate student at Smith College (University of Maryland) writing to apply for a Data Analyst Position at PCS GLOBAL TECH. Through Indeed I learned about this position.

Your job listing mentions a need for someone who is experienced in analysing skills and prioritizing business, both are areas I have extensive experience in. I have 1 year
of experience at FancyDigital, where I have honed my skills by manipulating several successful
data analysis projects, which involve the production of dashboards using BI reports and
dashboard tools (Especially Tableau). While employed here, I’ve collaborated with product
managers to design metrics and made dashboards to visualize the changes in user usage, which
successfully raised the number of customers by 5% over the course of five months, contributing
substantially to the company’s annual goals. I'm experienced in interpreting data and analyzing results from statistical results.

The strong ability of programming in SQL is mentioned in your job description, which is also an
important part of my previous job. As a data analyst, I often write SQL to extract data through
various methods, especially window functions. I've collaborated with software engineers to monitor
and display the causes of failures of various APIs in the SaaS system. At the same time, I tracked
the use of new users and the loss of old users, and analyzed the reasons and characteristics of
user churn. In the end, our user churn rate has dropped by 3%, reducing the company's potential
losses. Drawing reliable conclusions from the data is my advantage, and I am also experienced in
building causal inference models using Python and R.

I look forward to discussing the Data Analyst position and my qualifications with you in
more detail. I’m available to talk at your convenience. I’ll be in touch next week to follow up and to
make sure you’ve received my application.
Sincerely,
Xiao(Seanny) Song
