Dear 

I am a graduate student at Smith College writing to apply for data analyst at *** company. Through *** I learned about this position. 

Your job listing mentions a need for someone who is experienced in data analytics and data visualization, both of which are areas I have extensive experience in. I have one year experience in FancyDigital, where I’ve honed my skills by manipulating numerous successful data analysis projects. While employed here, I’ve collaborated with my team to design KPIs and made dashboards to visualize the changes in user usage, which successfully raised the number of customers by 5% over the course of five months, contributing substantially to the company’s annual goals.



I look forward to discussing the Data Analyst position and my qualifications with you in more detail. I’m available to talk at your convenience. I’ll be in touch next week to follow up and to make sure you’ve received my application.

Sincerely,

Xiao Song
